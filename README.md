# The Fibroblast Atlas

This repository describes the Fibroblast Atlas, an effort to establish a cross-tissue taxonomy for fibroblast states. The preprint below describes the first version of this atlas, with a focus on fibroblasts in human inflammatory diseases. The Atlas is available as a mappable reference object (on Zenodo) and can be used to map new single-cell datasets using Symphony reference mapping. 

- Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.426253v2
- Data: https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/772596#.YGsi6BRKg-Q
- Symphony reference mapping: https://github.com/immunogenomics/symphony

The vignettes included show the contents of the Atlas object and demonstrate how to map new data using the dermal fibroblasts example from the preprint. These data were first described in He et al J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 145, 1615â€“1628 (2020).
